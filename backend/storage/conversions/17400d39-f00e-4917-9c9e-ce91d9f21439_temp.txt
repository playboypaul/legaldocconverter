- "Pro Plan" → $3,500/month recurring → Copy Price ID
2. Create Webhook:
- Endpoint: https://getsortai.com/api/stripe/webhook
- Events: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted
- Copy Signing Secret
3. Add secrets to Replit:
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_xxxxx
- Update STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to live key if not already
Then update server/routes.ts line 786-789:
const priceIds: Record<string, string> = {
starter: "price_REAL_STARTER_ID_HERE",  // From Stripe Dashboard
pro: "price_REAL_PRO_ID_HERE",          // From Stripe Dashboard
};
